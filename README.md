## Hi there 👋❕ My name is Mason and I am an aspiring web developer!

My interest in coding branched from a particular hobby that I currently enjoy (you may be able to guess it from my projects 👀). Growing up with an artistical mindset and the need for aesthetics and visuals, I've worked on many things including art, technical drawings, and 3D modeling before my coding journey. I enjoy typing up minimalistic website designs and I'm interested in pursuing a career in web development.
